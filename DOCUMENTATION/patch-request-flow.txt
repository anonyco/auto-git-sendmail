Worked on Branch v0.1+core-cookie-login

They make N number of changes on their local machine 

Patch Request, saying Code has to be merged into v0.1+core-cookie-login

--Commit 1--

--Commit 2--

--Commit 3--



>>> take the commits
Merges them to v0.1+core-cookie-login
If v0.1+core-cookie-login is not present, reject the patch request

Developer goes back and updates the git-assembler file 
>>> build server will identify the changes to git assembler and creates an empty branch (based fully out of another branch without any unique commits of its own), pushes it to git server

Developer Creates new patch request

>>> Build server now has an empty branch to which it can push these commits to.

>>> Once unit tests are run the changes are pushed to git
